Megaopolis is an app that addresses the issue of Crowd Counting. Simply put, crowd counting is the task of trying to count the number of people in a large crowd ideally through automated means. Current ways of doing this include manual tally counters at the entrances of events, top-down satellite views that estimate, and most recently check-ins.  

However, such methods require a lot of manpower, are potentially very costly, and are many times not accurate (not everyone who goes to an event actually checks-in to the event). 

Thus, in order to address this problem, we turned towards the growing-area of computer vision. For our dataset, we looked to examining real-time webcam data in New York in order to count how many people there are at a given time.

In actuality this task takes a large amount of computing power, much more than can be afforded by three laptops. 

Hopefully this project can be extended to utilize methods found in papers such as [this](http://mplab.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/CVPR2008/Conference/data/papers/229.pdf).
