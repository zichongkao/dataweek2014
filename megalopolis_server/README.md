====================

The Server Component for the dataweek hackathon

How to Run
==========

If you don't have `bundler`, run `gem install bundler`

Then, run `bundle install`

To run the application `bundle exec rake server`. By default, it should run from port 9200.

- The server runs at `/server`
- The (mocked) client runs at `/client`
